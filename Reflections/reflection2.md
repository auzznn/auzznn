**Assignment 2**

Designing a poster for this assignment was both challenging and rewarding.
1. I improved my drawing skills by considering color schemes, fonts and graphic elements. 
2. Moving the poster in the limited space required me to prioritize information. 
3. Using a graphic design program improved my skills, while research became essential when gathering content.

Effective communication was central and emphasized clarity over aesthetics. 
Time management became a key skill as I balanced multiple aspects of the project. 
Feedback played a crucial role in the iterative design process, refining the final product.

In the future, I plan to fill the gaps in graphic design skills with continuing education. 
Incorporating different elements such as infographics is a goal for future projects. Seeking early feedback is a priority for iterative improvements. 
All in all, this mission was not just about fulfillment; it was a valuable opportunity for personal and skill development.
